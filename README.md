# Visa Checker mobile application

This is an android application for checking if you require a visa before visiting your destination.

## Download

To download the official release, visit the following links:

- Official nickypangers download page (in construction)
- Google Play Store (pending)

I recommend you to download via Google Play Store as the release there will always be the most up-to-date.

There are three builds available:
- Official Release
- Beta
- Alpha

Beta is always open and you join via Google Play Store (pending). Feel free to beta test and  report any issues by raising an issue in this repo.

Remember, builds other than the official release are not stable and may crash. This is normal as I will be experimenting frequently.

Alpha is only available for selected people and I will increase the test group when necessary. This build will be the least stable and features in the alpha may sometimes not be implemented into the official release.
